# Machine-Learning-Exercise

Welcome to the Machine Learning Exercise repository! This repository contains a collection of my past exercises and projects in machine learning. These projects were undertaken to learn and practice various machine learning algorithms and techniques. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with machine learning or an experienced practitioner looking to explore different implementations, you'll find useful resources here.
